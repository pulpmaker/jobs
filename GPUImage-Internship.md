# Internship: Image Processing with GPUImage

[YapMe](https://www.yapme.co) is a new platform enabling users to create, share, and discover visuals and music. Launching soon, and backed by multiple investors, we are actively working on new features based on feedback from our early beta-releases.

Among those, photo and live-video filters are one of our core priority. To reach this goal, we are looking for an intern to help us design and experiment new filters, based on the [GPUImage library](https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage). The internship will involve altering existing GPUImage filters, as well designing and implementing algorithms to create new ones - from coloration and optical effects to face-detection. Even though this involves some R&D, this is an engineering internship: we expect the code delivered to be fully operational in our application.

Our application is 100% Objective-C, backed by a infrastructure hosted on the Google Cloud Platform. While focused on the application itself, the internship is also an opportunity to learn more about Web and mobile architectures, APIs, unit testing, agile development, and more.

You will be supervised by our CTO, who owns a Ph.D. in CS and worked with the likes of Google and Cisco. You will also interact with the company co-founders, formerly at Facebook and Twitter, for the roadmap and requirements of the internship.

The position is based in our offices in the city centre of Dublin, Ireland, in a vibrant area close to various coffee shops, restaurants, and pubs. The internship is unpaid - but compensation will be provided based on the results -, and shall start ASAP for a minimum duration of 3 months, up to 6 months.

## Responsibilities

- Identify current GPUImage filters and their extensions
- Design combinations of existing filters using your creativity
- Identify and design new algorithms for filtering and face-detection
- Report directly to the company co-founders
- Have the opportunity to growth your skill-set by participating in other parts of or product engineering (back-end, etc.)

## Requirements

- A good knowledge of engineering fundamentals (algorithms, OOP, MVC architectures)
- Knowledge of image processing algorithms
- Fluency of at least one programming language
- A love for start-ups, mobile apps and innovation
- Fluency in English
- **Bonus**: Knowledge of Objective-C and experience building iOS apps
- **Bonus**: Fluency in French
